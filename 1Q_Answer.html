		'this' references the object that is executing the current function.
		In the below example1,
		we have created an object called person inside it we have created a function and used this in it.
		'this' keyword used in that function refers the object person.
		prints the output as
		<pre><code>
		{name: "DanBrown", work: ƒ}
		</code></pre>
		In the example2
		if 'this' keyword is used inside a normal/global function, then it will result the window object.
		<pre><code>
		Window {parent: Window, postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, …}
		</code></pre>
		<pre><code>
		work2 {workType: "Art Work"}
		</code></pre>
		if the same function object is created using the new keywork, then 'this' will point to the functions object.
	</td>
	<td>
		'let' is a key word in ES6/ES2015 which is used to declare the variables having block level scope.
		and the variables once declared cannot be once again declared in the same scope level.
		In the below example,
		let is used once outside the function and once inside the function.
		In this case, both the name variables become different because of its scope.
		that is why, this program prints output as
		<pre><code>
		Mike
		John
		</code></pre>
		if the let name inside the function is removed then the name which is declared and defined outside the function becomes 
		available to the function it self.
		the the output will be
		<pre><code>
		John
		John
		</code></pre>
